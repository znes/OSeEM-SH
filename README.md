# OSeEM-SN
## Open Sector-coupled Energy Model for Sub-national Energy Systems

OSeEM-SN is a tool constructed using Oemof Tabular to apply cross-sectoral approaches for analyzing 100% renewable and sector-coupled sub-national energy systems. The model is validated using the case study of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

To run the scripts, you need to install Oemof Tabular using the following command- 
```
pip install oemof.tabular
```
For details on Oemof Tabular please go through the documentation-
https://oemof-tabular.readthedocs.io/

The model uses Oemof-Solph, a model generator for energy system modelling and optimisation. The oemof.solph package is part of the Open energy modelling framework (Oemof). This an organisational framework to bundle tools for energy system modelling. Details on Oemof-Solph is described here- https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph

Further details of the model will be available soon.
